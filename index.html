  <p>I attend University of Maryland, and I am a student of the Philip Merrill College,
    where I study multiplatform journalism. I am
    also pursuing a double major in government and politics.
    At school, I write and copy edit for publications, including Her Campus, Stories Beneath the Shell,
    Unwind magazine, and The Black Explosion.</p>

  <p>Currently, I am working as an editorial intern at Baltimore magazine. There, I call sources
    to fact-check articles, write blurbs for event listings and write for
    the metro section of the magazine.</p>
